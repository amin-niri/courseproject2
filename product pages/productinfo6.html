		By literally and figuratively bringing forth a new dimension to to printing, 3D printers are the gatekeepers to so many avenues. This technology empowers users by giving them the capability of designing and executing designs with independence, accessibility, and affordability. <br><br>

		Apart from personal ventures, 3D printers are highly adaptable and suitable for various other fields. For example, there are already reports of 3D printers being designed to construct and "print" out organs such as human heart. The ability to “print” out functional organs is profound, as it has the potential of decreasing loss of human life through an endless and reliable supply of organs. It's simply exciting to even ponder about such a ground-breaking advancement. <br><br>

		Apart from areas such as medicine, 3D printers are already making a presence in the food industry. The world's first 3D printer bakery has opened in New York, featuring a multitude of "printed" cakes. Clients are invited to design to their hearts' desires when placing orders. Customers have given the bakery positive ratings, expressing that other than a slightly dry flavour, one cannot tell that the cakes have been printed versus baked. Such an application of 3D printers opens the avenue of “printing” edible food-a drastic convenience. <br><br>

		The rich applicability of this product makes it brim with potential. From improving fields such as the food industry to medicine, it's amazing to analyze the extensive effects of a single, lone product. One can only imagine what future advancements may be catalyzed with this wondrous invention! This is a testament to the incredibly diverse and valuable contributions computer science can have in our lives and industries.  <br><br>

		Although 3D printers are still being improved, they have already hit the market. A decent 3D printer can be yours for as little as $1000.
