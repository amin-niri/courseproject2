		Reports suggest that many research bodies including the University of San Diego are developing tools such as brain scanners. Combined with miniaturization progress, brain scanners can be implemented and used in a multi-faceted fashion. 
<br><br>
		For example, brain scanners could be fit into helmets, allowing external individuals to monitor one's thoughts. This specific tool can be applied and utilized for military and commercial pilots. Flying an aircraft requires firm concentration and focus. This technology would allow individuals to monitor a pilot's mental state and confirm that he/she is fully aware and not fatigued, unconscious or distracted. In the case that they are, a message can be sent that allows another pilot to step in and take over. Additionally, if a pilot begins to panic, this signal can be picked up immediately and appropriate help can be relayed instantaneously.
<br><br>
		Although the prospect of "being watched" sounds scary, this tool is highly advantageous when considering national security and aircraft accidents. Furthermore, flying aircraft is a highly sensitive task that is unforgiving for even the slightest of errors. When also considering pilots' draining and demanding schedules, this advancement seems appealing and highly beneficial. 
<br><br>
		Apart from safety and security, mind-reading helmets can help researchers study and better help patients affected with mental illnesses such as Autism. By literally being given the chance to "peek" in one's mind, researchers may be able to answer their burning questions and tackle roadblocks preventing them from fully assisting patients.
<br><br>
		As discussed, this simple technological advancement opens one to a world of possibility. It's exciting to consider the progress that has already been made in this field, and what this means for the future! Keep your eyes and ears peeled for more information on this captivating field of study!
